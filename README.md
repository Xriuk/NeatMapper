# .NEaT Mapper

Object mapper, with configurable and reusable mappings. Supports asynchronous mapping and services via Dependency Injection (DI).

## How to install

You can find all the packages on Nuget https://www.nuget.org/profiles/xriuk

Choose whether you need:
- The normal mapper ([NeatMapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NeatMapper))
- Or the async one (NeatMapper.Async) (coming soon)
- or both

If you are using Dependency Injection (DI) in your project you may want to install these packages instead:
- ([NeatMapper.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NeatMapper.DependencyInjection))
- (NeatMapper.Async.DependencyInjection) (coming soon)

They both include the relative package above
