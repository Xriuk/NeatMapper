.NEaT Mapper is an object mapper and projector, with configurable and reusable mappings.

This allows you to create mappings between different types (even generic ones), combine them, nest them and reuse them, making your code DRY. Map once, use everywhere.

All of this is achieved with strongly typed maps, easily debuggable, no compilation into obscure expressions, no black boxes.

It also supports asynchronous maps and services via Dependency Injection (DI).
